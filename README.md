## Development
This Discord bot is built with [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) using the [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/) framework.

### Required software
- You will need **node.js** and **npm**. For a POSIX-compliant environment, I recommend [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install these, if you do not have them already installed.
- A modern IDE such as [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is recommended aswell.

### Setting up
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Navigate to the root directory of the repository, and use `npm install` to install the required dependencies automatically.

### Running
